# Telecom-Churn-Risk-Analytics-using-Machine-Learning

ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project aims to predict market-level churn in the telecom industry â€” identifying operator Ã— region (circle) combinations at risk of losing subscribers.
By using machine learning, the project helps telecom providers proactively retain customers, allocate resources efficiently, and protect market share.

Focus: Market-level churn prediction (not individual customers)
Final Model: Random Forest Classifier
Objective: Detect early warning signs of subscriber loss and enable data-driven business decisions.

ðŸš€ Objectives

- Build an end-to-end churn prediction pipeline from raw telecom data.
- Identify top churn drivers and generate interpretable business insights.
- Deliver actionable recommendations for retention and marketing strategies.
- Ensure the model is robust, explainable, and production-ready.

ðŸ§  Methodology
Phase 1 â€” Foundation & Market Intelligence

- Conducted data integrity checks and time range validation.
- Performed exploratory analysis on subscriber trends, operator performance, and market dynamics.
- Identified key business patterns and early hypotheses for churn causes.

Phase 2 â€” Feature Engineering & Target Definition

- Created time-series features (rolling averages, volatility, and slopes).
- Calculated market share, rank, and leader gap per circle.
- Defined future_churn using month-over-month decline patterns.
- Generated phase2_features.csv â€” the model-ready dataset.

Phase 3 â€” Model Development & Validation

- Built and compared three models:
Logistic Regression (baseline)
Random Forest Classifier âœ… (final selection)
CatBoost (for benchmark comparison)
- Evaluated using AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- Ensured temporal validation to avoid data leakage.

ðŸ“ˆ Final Model (Random Forest) Performance:

Metric	Score
AUC	0.960
Precision	0.628
Recall	0.868
F1-Score	0.729

âœ… Selected Model: Random Forest Classifier (balanced performance + interpretability)

Phase 4 â€” Business Analysis & Insight Generation

- Produced executive reports and playbooks explaining high-risk regions.
- Identified top 10 high-risk operatorâ€“circle pairs using churn probabilities.
- Linked model outputs to business recommendations:
High-risk â†’ targeted retention campaigns
Medium-risk â†’ engagement programs
Low-risk â†’ maintain excellence

Key Drivers Identified:
market_share â€” lower share indicates vulnerability.
trend_slope_12 â€” negative trends show sustained loss.
roll_std_6 â€” volatility signals unstable subscriber base.
rank_in_circle â€” lower rank means weaker competitive position.

ðŸ“„ Reports generated in /Reports/Phase-3 and /Reports/Phase-4 include:
Model Comparison Report
Interpretability Summary
Risk Playbook
Executive Summary (PDF and Markdown)

Phase 5 â€” Production Readiness (Next Step)

Planned for final submission:
- Automated scoring pipeline using trained Random Forest model.
- Batch prediction generation (phase4_predictions.csv).
- Dashboard integration for live risk monitoring.
- Retraining policy to ensure model stability over time.
